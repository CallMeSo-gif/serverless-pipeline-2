Why two repo ? 


The first one was not configured with SSH, just using HTTPS. 
then I can't make a push since git doesn't authorize username/password authentication anymore.

I had to generate a key and add the public SSH key, then create a repo with SSH AND FINALLY PUSH. 

That's all. 

Good bye and end of this activity.
